# Azrue-ARM
 Azure ARM Templates
 
Currently, this repo is being used for deploying ARM templates to assist in my training for AZ-104

The key function of this is to be able to deploy up to 4 fresh Windows 2019 Data Center servers will one command function

The associated PS1 file will be continiously updated to reflect additional requirements in the training

Current functions include the deployment of VMs, RGs, Networks; the automation of connections to those VMs, and the total removal at the end of the training session

The use of scripts may or may not be the most effective way to deploy these resources, but they require a greater understanding of them to get them to function within a script
